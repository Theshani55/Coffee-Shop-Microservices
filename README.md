# Coffee Shop Microservices

A modern, distributed coffee shop management system built using microservices architecture with Spring Boot.

## Architecture Overview

The system consists of the following microservices:

- **Auth Service**: Handles user authentication and authorization
- **Customer Service**: Manages customer profiles and related operations
- **Menu Service**: Handles menu items, categories, and pricing
- **Order Service**: Processes and manages customer orders
- **Notification Service**: Handles customer and shop notifications
- **Queue Service**: Manages order queuing and processing
- **Shop Service**: Manages coffee shop locations and their details

## Technologies Used (for order service)

- Java 17
- Spring Boot
- Spring Cloud
- Spring Data JPA
- PostgreSQL
- Docker
- Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation

## Prerequisites

- JDK 17 or later
- Maven
- Docker and Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL

## Getting Started

### Quick Setup with Agent Mode üöÄ

For enhanced development with IntelliJ IDEA "agent mode" features (hot reload, debugging, monitoring):

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Coffee-Shop-Microservices.git
cd Coffee-Shop-Microservices
./setup-agent-mode.sh
```

**Windows:**
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Coffee-Shop-Microservices.git
cd Coffee-Shop-Microservices
setup-agent-mode.bat
```

Then follow the detailed setup guide: [INTELLIJ_AGENT_MODE_SETUP.md](INTELLIJ_AGENT_MODE_SETUP.md)

### Manual Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Coffee-Shop-Microservices.git
cd Coffee-Shop-Microservices
```

2. Build all services:
```bash
mvn clean package
```

3. Start the services using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
4. Stop the services when done:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

## API Documentation

Each service includes Swagger/OpenAPI documentation. After starting the services, you can access the API documentation at:
(For now ony order service can be accessed, others are under development)

- Customer profile management
- Menu management
- Order processing and tracking
- Shop location management
- Real-time notifications
- Order queuing and processing

### üõ†Ô∏è Development Features (Agent Mode)

- **Hot Reload**: Automatic application restart on code changes with Spring Boot DevTools
- **Live Reload**: Browser auto-refresh for static resources 
- **Remote Debugging**: Debug applications running in containers
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: All actuator endpoints enabled in development
- **Development Profiling**: Detailed SQL logging and debug information
- **IntelliJ Integration**: Pre-configured run configurations and project settings

## Testing

Order service contains unit tests and integration tests. To run the tests:

```bash
cd order-service
mvn test
```
